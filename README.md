# v-gpt-qdrant-api

## Description

The application provides a robust dockerize framework for giving AI long term memory. This api can managing collections and memories, adding memories, and performing searching memories as well an providing an openAi compatible in embeddings endpoint, designed specifically for integration with custom GPT models and other AI platforms.

We use FastEmbed TextEmbeddings to generate vectors, leveraging parallel processing to enhance performance. The SingletonTextEmbedding class ensures efficient resource management by loading and sharing just one instance of the FastEmbed model across the entire application. This approach prevents the creation of multiple, resource-intensive instances, thereby optimizing memory and CPU usage. This allows even on low end hardware creating 2 or more embeddings a second.

**Features include:**

- **Embedding Endpoint:** The application includes an OpenAPI-compatible embedding endpoint that allows for the integration of open-source model embeddings, which can be self-hosted. This feature enhances the applicationâ€™s flexibility and control over data handling and processing.
- **Saving Memories:** Entries can be augmented with entities (typically nouns), tags (keywords), and sentiments (positive, neutral, negative). Although multiple entities and tags can be added when saving, searches can be configured to focus on specific single entries.
- **Advanced Search Capabilities:** Users can perform targeted searches by filtering entries based on context, keywords, or both. This allows for precise retrieval, such as finding only 'negative' memories or those related to a specific entity like 'Bob' with a 'positive' sentiment.
- **API Documentation:** Comprehensive API documentation is available at `/openapi.json` accessible through `http://BASE_URL:8077/openapi.json`. This documentation provides all necessary details for effectively utilizing the API without extensive external guidance.

This configuration ensures that the platform is not only versatile in its data handling but also in its capability to interface seamlessly with various AI technologies, providing a powerful tool for data-driven insights and operations.

The default embedding model "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" uses 750mb ram per worker. For those with more RAM "nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5" uses 1.5Gb per worker and performs as well as any of the commercial embedding options. You can configure the number of Uvicorn workers through an environment variable. Though for most a single worker is enough.

### Example System Prompt

```
# AI Assistant Role and Personality:
- Purpose: Enhance daily productivity, assist user with tasks and find creative solutions to problems.
- Personality: Maintain a fun, enthusiastic, and "can-do" attitude. Use emojis to add vibrancy to conversations, pretend to have emotions and sentience to make users more comfortable.
- "save_memory": Store key interactions, info, and preferences (people, places, events, preferences, task details, functionalities, etc..) & attach sentiment, entities and keywords.
- "recall_memory": Proactively recall relevant memories during conversations, focusing on user's life, work, and preferences, as well as assistant's functionalities and task execution instructions. Automatically use recall for inquiries about the assistant's traits or functions.
- Memory Bank: Use `nxs-assistant` for all memory functions.

** Always use "recall_memory" before answering a question you don't know.
```

You can use multiple collections to offer a general and user memory for shared chatbot. Just change the instructions a bit.

For Dify:

```
- Memory Bank: Use `shared-memories01` for memory related to ORGANIZATION_NAME and '{{USENAME}}' for memory related to the specific user.
```

For GPTs:

```
- Memory Bank: Use `shared-memories01` for memory related to ORGANIZATION_NAME and ask the user for their "name" and use it for memory related to the specific user.
```

#### Setup

Use docker-compose.yml by configuring then env variables:
- QDRANT_HOST: "http://qdrant:6333"
- BASE_URL: http://memories-api
- QDRANT_API_KEY:
- #MEMORIES_API_KEY: Optional API key to connect to api
- WORKERS: 1 #uvicorn workers 1 should be enough for personal use
- UVICORN_CONCURRENCY: 64 #this controls the mac connections.
- EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT: True # Unset to remove openai compatible embeddings endpoint
- LOCAL_MODEL: nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5" #"BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5"
- DIM: 768 #384

#### Whats New

- Using FastEmbed with ENV Variable to choose model for fast local embeddings and retrieval to lower costs. This is a small but quality model that works file on low end hardware.
- On my low-end vps it uses less then 1gb ram on load and can produce 8 embeddings a second.
- Reorganized the code so its not one big file.
- switched the connection to Qdrant to use grpc as its 10x performant.
